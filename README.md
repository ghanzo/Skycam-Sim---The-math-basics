The camera can be positioned anywhere over the field by extending the 4 cables to the correct lengths!

Controlled by 4 motors placed at ground level outside stadium.
Cables strung in a rectangular pattern over the top of the stadium.
Cables meet in the center of the stadium and connect to the camera.
Cables length is controlled by motors.
All 4 lengths determine the position.

##Movement
Movement of the camera requires non-linear motor behavior
Stepper motors STEP a fraction of an rpm per electronic pulse
RPM can be controlled by rate of pulses sent to motors
